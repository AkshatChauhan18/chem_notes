# Detailed Notes on Battery Technology

## Introduction to Batteries

- **Importance of Batteries**: Batteries are integral to modern life, powering a vast array of devices and systems such as clocks, watches, vehicles, computers, remote controls, cameras, laptops, cell phones, heart pacemakers, toys, and more.

- **Versatility**: Different applications require batteries with varying properties. For instance, starting a car requires a battery capable of delivering a large current in a short time, whereas a cardiac pacemaker needs a small, leak-proof battery that delivers a steady current over a long period.

- **Industry Significance**: The battery industry is enormous, with a global turnover of billions, reflecting the critical role batteries play in technology and daily life.

## Types of Batteries

### Primary Batteries

- **Definition**: Non-rechargeable batteries that produce electricity from chemicals sealed within them during manufacture. Once depleted(reaction reached equilibrium), they cannot be efficiently recharged and must be discarded.

- **Characteristics**:
  - Known as "throw-away" or irreversible batteries.
  - Common examples include dry cells and lithium copper sulfide cells.

- **Requirements**:
  - Compact and lightweight.
  - Made from readily available raw materials.
  - Economical with minimal environmental impact.
  - High energy density and long shelf life.
  - Provide constant voltage over a long discharge period.

### Secondary Batteries

- **Definition**: Rechargeable batteries that can be recharged by passing an external current through them, reversing the chemical reactions that occur during discharge.

- **Characteristics**:
  - Also known as storage cells, accumulators, or rechargeable cells.
  - Examples include lead-acid batteries, nickel-cadmium cells, and lithium-ion batteries.

- **Requirements**:
  - Long shelf life in both charged and discharged states.
  - High cycle life and design life.
  - High power-to-weight ratio.
  - Short recharge times.
  - High voltage and energy density.

## Basic Principles of Battery Operation

- **Electrochemical Reactions**: Batteries operate based on redox (reduction-oxidation) reactions, involving the transfer of electrons between two chemical reactions—one at the anode (oxidation) and one at the cathode (reduction).

- **Physical Separation**: The oxidation and reduction reactions are physically separated within the battery, allowing electrons to flow through an external circuit, providing electrical power to a connected load.

- **Components**:
  - **Anode**: The electrode where oxidation occurs, releasing electrons.
  - **Cathode**: The electrode where reduction occurs, accepting electrons.
  - **Electrolyte**: A medium that allows the flow of ions between the anode and cathode.
  - **Separator**: A barrier that prevents physical contact between the anode and cathode while allowing ion flow.
  - **External Circuit**: A conductive path that allows electrons to flow from the anode to the cathode.

## Electrodes and Electrolytes

### Electrodes

- **Function**: Serve as the site for redox reactions and electron transfer.

- **Materials**:
  - **Anode**: Should have a low redox potential, high specific capacity, reversibility, and good conductivity.
  - **Cathode**: Should have a high redox potential, high specific capacity, reversibility, and stability with the electrolyte.

- **Selection Criteria**:
  - The electrode materials are chosen based on their standard reduction potentials. A greater difference in potential between the cathode and anode results in a higher cell voltage.

### Electrolytes

- **Function**: Conduct ions between the anode and cathode.

- **Types**:
  - **Liquid Electrolytes**: Often used in traditional batteries; they have low viscosity and high ionic conductivity.
  - **Solid Electrolytes**: Provide benefits like no leakage, high safety, and thermal stability but may have lower ionic conductivity at room temperature.
  - **Polymer Electrolytes**: Can be gel or solid; gel polymers have higher ionic conductivities but lower mechanical strength.

- **Desired Properties**:
  - High ionic conductivity.
  - No electronic conductivity.
  - Chemical stability and non-reactivity with electrodes.
  - Wide operating temperature range.

## Redox Reactions and Electron Transfer

- **Redox Reaction**: Involves the transfer of electrons between species; one undergoes oxidation (loss of electrons), and the other undergoes reduction (gain of electrons).

- **Half-Reactions**:
  - **Oxidation at Anode**: \( \text{R} \rightarrow \text{O} + n e^- \)
  - **Reduction at Cathode**: \( \text{O} + n e^- \rightarrow \text{R} \)

- **Overall Reaction**: The combination of the two half-reactions represents the complete redox process in the battery.

## Key Battery Performance Metrics

### 1. Cell Potential (Voltage)

- **Definition**: The difference in electrode potentials between the cathode and anode.

- **Formula**:

  $\text{E}_{\text{cell}}$

  Where:
  - \( $\eta$ \) is the overpotential.
  - \( $iR_{\text{cell}}$ \) is the internal resistance drop.

- **Optimization**:
  - Maximize the difference in electrode potentials.
  - Minimize overpotentials by ensuring fast electrode reactions.The electrode systems should be such that the active mass at the positive electrode 
  depletes readily and that at the negative electrode increases easily.
  - Reduce internal resistance through battery design. This can be achieved by keeping the electrodes close to each other and by using an electrolyte of high conductivity.

### 2. Current

- **Definition**: The rate at which electrons flow during discharge, measured in amperes (A).

- **Importance**: Determines the battery's ability to deliver power; high conductivity electrolytes support higher currents.

### 3. Capacity

- **Definition**: The total charge a battery can deliver at the rated voltage, measured in ampere-hours (Ah).

- This depends on the size of the battery and is determined by the Faraday relation, 
- **Calculation**:
  \[
  $C = \frac{m \times n \times F}{M}$
  \]
  Where:
  - \( m \) is the mass of the active material.
  - \( n \) is the number of electrons transferred.
  - \( F \) is Faraday's constant.
  - \( M \) is the molar mass of the active material.

- **Factors Affecting Capacity**:
  - The amount of active materials consumed during discharge
  - Discharge conditions (current, temperature, etc.).
  - It is measured by 
  finding the time ‘t’ taken for the battery to reach a minimum voltage, $ E_{cell}^{min} $ for a fixed 
  current discharge (i amperes). (The cell is said to be dead at minimum voltage). A plot of 
  time against voltage at a fixed current discharge is shown in Fig. The length of the 
  flat portion of the curve is a measure of the capacity of the battery, the longer the flat 
  portion better the capacity.

### 4. Energy Density

- **Definition**: The ratio of the energy available from a battery to its mass (or volume) , measured in watt-hours per kilogram (Wh/kg) or watt-hours per liter (Wh/L).

- **Importance**: Higher energy density means the battery can store more energy in a smaller or lighter package.

- Energy density is determined by measuring the capacity and recording the average 
voltage (voltage averaged during the discharge) and the total mass (or volume) of the 
battery

- A battery should have continuous energy density above a certain value or a very 
high energy density for a short period.

### 5. Power Density

- **Definition**: The ratio of the power available from a battery to its mass (W/kg) or 
volume (W/L).

- **Importance**: Determines the battery's ability to deliver high currents and is critical for applications requiring bursts of power.

- A battery should have continuous power density above a certain value or a high value for a short period
### 6. Energy Efficiency

- **Definition**: The ratio of energy output during discharge to energy input during charging.

- **Formula**:
  \[
  $\text{Energy Efficiency (\%)} = \left( \frac{\text{Energy Discharged}}{\text{Energy required for Charging}} \right) \times 100$
  \]

- **Factors Affecting Efficiency**:
  - Overpotentials during charge and discharge.
  - Internal resistance.
  - Current efficiency of electrode processes.

### 7. Cycle Life

- **Definition**: The number of complete charge-discharge cycles a battery can undergo before its capacity falls below a specific percentage of its original capacity(failure occurs).
- It is necessary that during charging the active material is regenerated in a suitable state for 
discharge. 
- **Importance**: Indicates battery longevity; affected by factors like electrode degradation(shredding of active material), corrosion at contact points,short circuit, and morphological changes.

### 8. Shelf Life

- **Definition**: The duration a battery can be stored without significant loss of performance under specified conditions.

- **Factors Influencing Shelf Life**:
  - Self-discharge rates.
  - Chemical stability of materials.
  - Storage conditions (temperature, humidity,vibration and shock).

- Self-discharge 
occurs when there is a reaction between the anode and the cathode active materials or 
corrosion of current collectors.
