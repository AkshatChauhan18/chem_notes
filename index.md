- **Versatility**: Different applications require batteries with varying properties. For instance, starting a car requires a battery capable of delivering a large current in a short time, whereas a cardiac pacemaker needs a small, leak-proof battery that delivers a steady current over a long period.

- **Industry Significance**: The battery industry is enormous, with a global turnover of billions, reflecting the critical role batteries play in technology and daily life.

## Types of Batteries

### Primary Batteries

- **Definition**: Non-rechargeable batteries that produce electricity from chemicals sealed within them during manufacture. Once depleted, they cannot be efficiently recharged and must be discarded.

  - Compact and lightweight.
  - Made from readily available raw materials.
  - Economical with minimal environmental impact.
  - High energy density and long shelf life.
  - Provide constant voltage over a long discharge period.

### Secondary Batteries

- **Definition**: Rechargeable batteries that can be recharged by passing an external current through them, reversing the chemical reactions that occur during discharge.

- **Characteristics**:
  - Also known as storage cells, accumulators, or rechargeable cells.
  - Examples include lead-acid batteries, nickel-cadmium cells, and lithium-ion batteries.

- **Requirements**:

## Basic Principles of Battery Operation

- **Electrochemical Reactions**: Batteries operate based on redox (reduction-oxidation) reactions, involving the transfer of electrons between two chemical reactionsâ€”one at the anode (oxidation) and one at the cathode (reduction).

- **Physical Separation**: The oxidation and reduction reactions are physically separated within the battery, allowing electrons to flow through an external circuit, providing electrical power to a connected load.

- **Components**:
  - **Anode**: The electrode where oxidation occurs, releasing electrons.
  - **Cathode**: The electrode where reduction occurs, accepting electrons.
  - **Electrolyte**: A medium that allows the flow of ions between the anode and cathode.
  - **Separator**: A barrier that prevents physical contact between the anode and cathode while allowing ion flow.
  - **External Circuit**: A conductive path that allows electrons to flow from the anode to the cathode.

## Electrodes and Electrolytes

### Electrodes

- **Function**: Serve as the site for redox reactions and electron transfer.

- **Materials**:
  - **Anode**: Should have a low redox potential, high specific capacity, reversibility, and good conductivity.
  - **Cathode**: Should have a high redox potential, high specific capacity, reversibility, and stability with the electrolyte.

- **Selection Criteria**:
  - The electrode materials are chosen based on their standard reduction potentials. A greater difference in potential between the cathode and anode results in a higher cell voltage.

### Electrolytes

- **Function**: Conduct ions between the anode and cathode.

- **Types**:
  - **Liquid Electrolytes**: Often used in traditional batteries; they have low viscosity and high ionic conductivity.
  - **Solid Electrolytes**: Provide benefits like no leakage, high safety, and thermal stability but may have lower ionic conductivity at room temperature.
  - **Polymer Electrolytes**: Can be gel or solid; gel polymers have higher ionic conductivities but lower mechanical strength.

- **Desired Properties**:
  - High ionic conductivity.
  - No electronic conductivity.
  - Chemical stability and non-reactivity with electrodes.
  - Wide operating temperature range.

## Redox Reactions and Electron Transfer

- **Redox Reaction**: Involves the transfer of electrons between species; one undergoes oxidation (loss of electrons), and the other undergoes reduction (gain of electrons).

- **Half-Reactions**:
  - **Oxidation at Anode**: \( \text{R} \rightarrow \text{O} + n e^- \)
  - **Reduction at Cathode**: \( \text{O} + n e^- \rightarrow \text{R} \)

- **Overall Reaction**: The combination of the two half-reactions represents the complete redox process in the battery.
